# AI Study Chat

Module 37. First streaming AI feature — multi-turn conversations with a
syllabus-aware Gemini persona.

## Why this breaks the Server-Actions-first rule

Server Actions in Next 15 finalise their response into a single JSON
payload — they can't stream tokens as they arrive. Chat UX is
streaming-first (typing indicator, tokens appearing letter by letter),
so this is one of the explicit "streaming" exceptions from the
Server-Actions-first constitution (ADR-0002 carve-out; see ADR-0026).

The **write path** for messages stays split:
- One-shot mutations (create conversation, delete conversation) use Server
  Actions like every other feature.
- The stream+persist step uses the API route `POST /api/chat`.

## Data model

```
public.chat_conversations
├── id, user_id, subject_id (nullable), title, created_at, updated_at

public.chat_messages
├── id, conversation_id, user_id ← denormalized for trivial RLS
├── role ('user' | 'assistant'), content
├── created_at
```

`user_id` denormalised on `chat_messages` so RLS is `auth.uid() = user_id`
— identical pattern to `flashcards`, `quiz_questions`, etc.

Titles auto-derive from the first ~40 chars of the opening user message.

## Streaming flow — `POST /api/chat`

1. Auth check → 401 if signed out.
2. Load student context via `getStudentContext()` — same helper every AI
   feature uses.
3. Load conversation + prior messages (RLS filters).
4. Insert the incoming user message immediately (survives a client
   hang-up mid-stream).
5. Build Gemini `history` array — inject the `buildChatSystemPrompt`
   output as a synthetic `user → model "OK"` opener, then append every
   prior message.
6. Call `getGeminiChatModel()` — the prose-output variant of
   `getGeminiModel()` (no `responseMimeType: application/json`).
7. `sendMessageStream` → for-await → `controller.enqueue()` on each
   chunk.
8. In `finally`: persist the full assistant reply, bump the conversation's
   `updated_at`, revalidate `/app/chat/{id}`.

If the client aborts mid-stream, whatever tokens were buffered still get
saved — partial data > lost data.

## Client streaming

`<ChatView>` reads the response body with `getReader()` + `TextDecoder`.
Chunks append to a `pending` state; when the reader is done we clear
`pending` and call `router.refresh()` so the server-rendered messages
pull the new persisted rows.

`?auto=1` on the initial navigation (set by `<NewChatForm>`) auto-fires
the first assistant reply — the student doesn't have to click "Send" on
their own opening message.

## Prompt

`lib/gemini/prompts/chat.ts` writes a system prompt tuned for study
help:
- Injects board, class, medium, and (optionally) the subject scope.
- Enforces the study-medium language.
- Enforces concise, one-example answers.
- Encourages an admission of uncertainty over invented facts.

## Routes

- `/app/chat` — list of conversations
- `/app/chat/new` — subject picker + first-message textarea
- `/app/chat/[id]` — the conversation view + streaming input

Not in the 5-item nav. Discoverable via a Workspace tile.

## Save-as-note (Module 40)

Every persisted assistant bubble carries a small `<SaveAsNoteButton>`
that opens a subject picker; on confirm, `saveMessageAsNote({ messageId,
subjectId })` inserts a note prefixed with `From your AI Study Chat:`
and returns the new note id so the dialog offers a direct link to it.
Only rows with `role='assistant'` and non-empty content are eligible.

## Vision chat (Module 41)

`chat_messages` gains an `attachments jsonb` column; a new
`chat-attachments` Storage bucket (10 MB max, PNG/JPEG/WEBP) holds the
image bytes under `{user_id}/{conversation_id}/{uuid}.{ext}`. Flow:

1. Client picks image → `beginAttachmentUpload` returns a signed upload
   URL (bytes never touch our server — same pattern as the study-space
   module).
2. Client PUTs the file directly to Supabase Storage.
3. Client posts `{ conversationId, message, attachments: [{ path,
   mimeType }] }` to `/api/chat`.
4. The API route downloads each attachment from Storage as base64 and
   forwards it as an `inlineData` part to `getGeminiChatModel()`.
5. Only the CURRENT turn's attachments are forwarded — prior images
   aren't re-sent (token-budget win; students can re-attach if
   needed).
6. Rendering fetches a short-lived signed URL client-side on mount
   via `getAttachmentUrl(path)` — RLS on `storage.objects` gates who
   can mint the URL.

Empty text is allowed when an image is attached — the API route
substitutes a stock "please look at this image" prompt.

## Ask-AI-about-this-note (Module 42)

`<AskAiButton>` on the note detail calls `startChatFromNote(noteId)`:
the action reads the note (RLS-gated), creates a conversation scoped
to the note's subject, seeds it with an opening user message
containing up to 3500 chars of note content plus an instruction to
"ask me a question to check I've understood", and `redirect()`s to
`/app/chat/{id}?auto=1` — the same `?auto=1` handshake as
`<NewChatForm>` so the assistant auto-answers.

## Edit + regenerate (Module 43)

`POST /api/chat` gained a `mode` field: `send` (default) or
`regenerate`. In regenerate mode the API route DOESN'T insert a new
user row — it pulls the trailing user turn from history and uses that
as the current turn instead. This powers two flows:

- **Edit**: `<MessageBubble>` pencil on any persisted user turn opens
  an inline textarea. On save, `editMessage({ messageId, content })`
  overwrites the row AND deletes every message with `created_at >`
  the edited row's timestamp (assistant reasoning based on the old
  text is now invalid). The client then hits `/api/chat` with
  `mode: 'regenerate'` for a fresh reply.
- **Regenerate**: a small refresh chip on the last assistant reply
  calls `prepareRegenerate({ conversationId })` — deletes just the
  trailing assistant row and returns the user question — then streams
  a fresh reply via `mode: 'regenerate'`.

Bonus fix: the `?auto=1` handshake now also uses `mode: 'regenerate'`,
which fixes an old bug where `<NewChatForm>` and `startChatFromNote`
seeded a user message AND then the API route inserted a duplicate copy.

## PDF attachments (Module 44)

Bucket allowlist now includes `application/pdf`; size limit bumped
10 MB → 25 MB because scanned pages routinely exceed 10. Client picker
`accept` widened to `image/png,image/jpeg,image/webp,application/pdf`;
the preview card falls back to a filecard when the picked type is a
PDF. `<AttachmentThumb>` renders persisted PDFs as a clickable
filecard, images stay as `<Image>`. The Gemini forward path is
unchanged — 1.5-flash accepts PDF `inlineData` natively.

## Voice input (Module 45)

`useVoiceInput()` wraps the Web Speech API. On supported browsers
(Chrome/Edge/Safari) the input toolbar gains a mic button. Tapping
starts a `continuous`, `interimResults` recognition session; the
interim transcript renders live above the input, and completed phrases
append to the textarea using a `voiceBaselineRef` snapshot of pre-mic
content so existing typed text isn't wiped. Sending or hitting the
mic again stops recognition. Firefox and older WebKit builds return
`supported: false` — the button never renders instead of showing a
dead affordance.

## Chat → note (Module 46)

`<SaveChatAsNoteButton>` in the chat header flattens every turn into
one note via `saveConversationAsNote({ conversationId, subjectId })`.
Format: `**You:**` / `**AI:**` blocks separated by `---`. Attachments
aren't copied — they stay in the chat — but each turn that had one
gets a `_[N attachments — see original chat]_` marker so the reader
knows why the note might look incomplete. Success screen offers a
direct link to the new note.

## What this module does NOT do

- **Rate limiting** — deferred until we see abuse.
- **Conversation naming** — one-shot auto-title from the first message.
  No rename UI in v1.
- **Web search grounding** — Gemini's `googleSearchRetrieval` tool is
  out of scope; the assistant answers from its own training only.
- **Multi-image attachments** — one attachment per message in v1.
- **Re-sending prior attachments in history** — turn-local only (ADR-0027).
- **Editing an already-attached image** — edit only rewrites text.
- **Voice on Firefox** — Web Speech API not implemented there; button
  is hidden.

## Enhancement ideas

1. **Multi-image messages** — expand the client picker to accept up to
   4 images; the API route already loops.
2. **Conversation folders** — group chats by topic when the list gets
   long.
3. **Chat rename** — a small pencil on the header title.
4. **Undo edit** — cache the previous message body for 30 s so a
   mis-edit can be reverted without losing the follow-up.
5. **Speech language switcher** — surface `lang` picker for non-English
   dictation (the hook already accepts it as a parameter).
